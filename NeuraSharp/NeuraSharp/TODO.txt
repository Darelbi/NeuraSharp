- Bias initializer
- Weight initializer

At least Zero, Xavier and random uniform

- Compile time exceptions or warnings for incompatible builds (i.E, exception if using Xavier with ReLU)
- Fix dropout
- Sparse layer

- handling dimensional input/output => propedeutic to convolutional and pooling layers
- convolutional and pooling => 2D input => requires flattening, does exist the opposite of flattening?


-batch normalization
-residual layers
