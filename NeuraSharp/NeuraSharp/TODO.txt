- Compile time exceptions or warnings for incompatible builds (i.E, exception if using Xavier with ReLU)
- Fix dropout
- Sparse layer

- handling dimensional input/output => propedeutic to convolutional and pooling layers
- convolutional and pooling => 2D input => requires flattening, does exist the opposite of flattening?


-batch normalization
-residual layers

-orthogonal initalization for weights

- Initial features present => SMALL TEST BEFORE IMPLEMENTING SPARSE LAYERS AND CORRECT DROPOUT

WHAT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED?

- Embed batch size?
- Removing useless dependencies from GenericTensor. If something is not opensource => remove it
